#### Impression
Radiological imaging performed within the last five years does not reveal any acute intra-abdominal processes or significant findings related to the patient's current presentation of acute liver injury. The CT and MRI findings are largely stable and consistent with previous evaluations, showing mild diverticulosis and otherwise unremarkable liver parenchyma. There is no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary obstruction, or cirrhosis on the reviewed imaging.

#### Audit & Review
- Reviewed patient context, medication history (including Methotrexate and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), and laboratory findings indicating acute liver injury.
- Executed a search for final, finalized radiology reports (category LP29684-5) for Sarah Miller, filtered by CT, MRI, and X-Ray modalities, with a date range from 2019-01-01 onwards.
- All retrieved reports were reviewed for consistency with the patient's clinical presentation. The findings from these reports do not directly explain the current acute liver injury but provide baseline information.
- Data source: FHIR DiagnosticReport endpoint.
