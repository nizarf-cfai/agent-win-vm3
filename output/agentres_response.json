Key findings include severe hepatocellular injury (ALT 1650 U/L, AST 2100 U/L), jaundice (Total Bilirubin 12.5 mg/dL), hepatic encephalopathy, and elevated creatinine. The report outlines the patient's relevant medical history, including Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hypertension, and CKD, as well as current medications. Management recommendations include discontinuation of offending agents, ICU admission, supportive care, and consultations with Hepatology, Gastroenterology, and Hematology.\n\n**Verification:**\n*   **Completeness:** All relevant clinical data from recent encounters, laboratory results, and medication history have been included. The acute event summary, diagnostic assessment, and management plan are comprehensive.\n*   **Accuracy:** Data points (lab values, dates, medication dosages) have been cross-referenced with available patient encounter data. The diagnosis and assessment are based on established clinical guidelines (EASL).\n\n**Formatting for EHR:** The report is formatted in a structured markdown, suitable for direct import or transcription into an EHR system, including clear sections for patient demographics, problem list, acute event summary, diagnostic assessment, management plan, and relevant chronic history.\n\n---\n\n#### EHR System Integration\n\n**Action:** Sarah Miller's clinical report has been prepared and formatted for entry into the EHR system.
