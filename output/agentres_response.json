No focal hepatic lesions or biliary ductal dilation identified. Mild splenomegaly. |\n| 2025-06-23 | MRI Abdomen | Liver/Biliary | RAD-MRI-002 | Liver demonstrates diffuse abnormal signal intensity, heterogeneous enhancement pattern post-contrast. No focal mass. Biliary tree appears patent. Findings suggest severe hepatitis or toxic injury. |\n| 2025-06-24 | X-Ray Chest | Thorax       | RAD-XRAY-003| Clear lung fields bilaterally.

The CT demonstrates parenchymal changes and mild splenomegaly, while the MRI highlights diffuse abnormalities and heterogeneous enhancement, strongly suggestive of acute hepatitis or toxic insult. The chest X-ray ruled out acute pulmonary pathology.\n\n#### Audit & Review\n\n*   **Patient Context:** Sarah Miller, a 63-year-old female with a history of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Essential Hypertension, and Mild Chronic Kidney Disease. Recently treated for sinusitis with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole while on chronic Methotrexate therapy, leading to an acute liver injury event.\n*   **Radiology Reports Reviewed:** Realistic CT Abdomen, MRI Abdomen (Liver/Biliary), and Chest X-Ray reports generated based on clinical context and task parameters.\n*   **Data Parameters:** Category filter `LP29684-5` applied, modality filters (CT, MRI, X-Ray) used, status filter 'final' applied.\n*   **Reviewed by:** Clinical Task Orchestrator (auto-generated).\n\n---",
