    "overallImpression": "Sarah Miller, a 63-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and mild CKD, presented with acute jaundice, epigastric pain, and confusion. Her presentation is highly suggestive of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), likely a severe hepatocellular pattern, with a strong temporal association to the initiation of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) while on chronic Methotrexate (MTX) therapy. The clinical picture, including encephalopathy and significant transaminitis, meets criteria for acute liver failure.",

Known hepatotoxicity: TMP-SMX is a known cause of idiosyncratic DILI. Interaction with Methotrexate: TMP-SMX can inhibit renal excretion and metabolism of methotrexate, increasing its serum levels and toxicity, which is consistent with the concurrent findings and patient history of mouth ulcers and pancytopenia (implied by low WBC and platelets in ED note)."
