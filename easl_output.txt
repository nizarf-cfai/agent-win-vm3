This is strongly suspected to be drug-induced, with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as the most likely trigger, potentially potentiated by her chronic Methotrexate (MTX) use. The presentation includes jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and marked elevations in ALT and AST, meeting criteria for acute liver failure.",
