        "content": "# Short Answer\nFor Sarah Miller's suspected DILI with critically elevated ALT, EASL recommends immediate discontinuation of all non-essential implicated medications (Methotrexate, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Lisinopril) and a comprehensive diagnostic workup to exclude alternative causes, including viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Monitoring for signs of acute liver failure is crucial, with hospitalization and transplant referral if present. Specific therapies are generally not indicated for her implicated drugs, but steroids could be considered if autoimmune hepatitis is suspected after serological testing.\n\n# Detailed Answer\nThe primary EASL recommendation for Sarah Miller's suspected DILI, given her critically elevated ALT and medication history, is the **immediate discontinuation of all non-essential implicated medications**. Methotrexate, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), and Lisinopril are all listed as drugs associated with idiosyncratic DILI . The critically elevated ALT meets the thresholds for treatment discontinuation in clinical trials (ALT >8 ULN or ALT >3 ULN with symptoms) , strongly supporting immediate cessation. Once discontinued, patients should not be re-exposed to the suspected drug .\n\n        Concurrently, a comprehensive **diagnostic workup** is mandatory to confirm DILI and exclude alternative causes. This should include serum aminotransferases (ALT/AST), ALP, and TBL to define liver damage and dysfunction . Given the critically elevated ALT, a hepatocellular pattern of injury is likely, which necessitates testing for HCV-RNA and anti-HEV IgM (or HEV-RNA), in addition to HAV, HBV, and autoimmune serology . Screening for auto-antibodies and serum IgG is mandatory for hepatocellular patterns . If AST is disproportionately high, CPK testing is recommended to differentiate liver from muscle injury .\n\n        **Specific therapies** for DILI are generally limited, as spontaneous recovery after drug withdrawal is common . Cholestyramine is only recommended for very selected drugs with enterohepatic circulation, such as leflunomide and terbinafine, to speed up clearance . None of Sarah's implicated medications fall into this category. Steroids can be considered if autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an option or in cases with marked hypersensitivity features . Given Sarah's Rheumatoid Arthritis, an autoimmune predisposition might make AIH a consideration, but this requires further serological testing.\n\n        **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Patients with DILI should have liver biochemistry routinely tested until complete normalization . Careful scrutiny of hepatocellular cases with jaundice in females and all other cases with altered INR is necessary for impending liver failure . If Sarah develops jaundice or signs of acute liver failure (ALF) such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy (INR >1.5), she should be hospitalized and referred to a liver transplant unit .\n\n# References\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Aminotransferases\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Introduction to DILI Classification\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-General Treatment Measures\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Patterns of DILI\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Decision to Stop Drug Administration\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Specific Therapies: Cholestyramine\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Chronic DILI\n",

            "markdown": "# Short Answer\nFor Sarah Miller's suspected DILI with critically elevated ALT, EASL recommends immediate discontinuation of all non-essential implicated medications (Methotrexate, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Lisinopril) and a comprehensive diagnostic workup to exclude alternative causes, including viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Monitoring for signs of acute liver failure is crucial, with hospitalization and transplant referral if present. Specific therapies are generally not indicated for her implicated drugs, but steroids could be considered if autoimmune hepatitis is suspected after serological testing.\n\n# Detailed Answer\nThe primary EASL recommendation for Sarah Miller's suspected DILI, given her critically elevated ALT and medication history, is the **immediate discontinuation of all non-essential implicated medications**. Methotrexate, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), and Lisinopril are all listed as drugs associated with idiosyncratic DILI . The critically elevated ALT meets the thresholds for treatment discontinuation in clinical trials (ALT >8 ULN or ALT >3 ULN with symptoms) , strongly supporting immediate cessation. Once discontinued, patients should not be re-exposed to the suspected drug .\n\n        Concurrently, a comprehensive **diagnostic workup** is mandatory to confirm DILI and exclude alternative causes. This should include serum aminotransferases (ALT/AST), ALP, and TBL to define liver damage and dysfunction . Given the critically elevated ALT, a hepatocellular pattern of injury is likely, which necessitates testing for HCV-RNA and anti-HEV IgM (or HEV-RNA), in addition to HAV, HBV, and autoimmune serology . Screening for auto-antibodies and serum IgG is mandatory for hepatocellular patterns . If AST is disproportionately high, CPK testing is recommended to differentiate liver from muscle injury .\n\n        **Specific therapies** for DILI are generally limited, as spontaneous recovery after drug withdrawal is common . Cholestyramine is only recommended for very selected drugs with enterohepatic circulation, such as leflunomide and terbinafine, to speed up clearance . None of Sarah's implicated medications fall into this category. Steroids can be considered if autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an option or in cases with marked hypersensitivity features . Given Sarah's Rheumatoid Arthritis, an autoimmune predisposition might make AIH a consideration, but this requires further serological testing.\n\n        **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Patients with DILI should have liver biochemistry routinely tested until complete normalization . Careful scrutiny of hepatocellular cases with jaundice in females and all other cases with altered INR is necessary for impending liver failure . If Sarah develops jaundice or signs of acute liver failure (ALF) such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy (INR >1.5), she should be hospitalized and referred to a liver transplant unit .\n\n# References\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Aminotransferases\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Introduction to DILI Classification\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-General Treatment Measures\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Laboratory Workup for Excluding Alternative Causes\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Patterns of DILI\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Decision to Stop Drug Administration\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Specific Therapies: Cholestyramine\n- EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury-Chronic DILI\n"

There is low likelihood of alternative causes\u2014no fever or hemodynamic instability to suggest ischemic or septic hepatitis, viral panels are pending with low pretest probability, and there is no autoimmune or metabolic history. Mechanistically, TMP-SMX can raise free methotrexate levels and impair folate metabolism; in an older patient with alcohol use (and possible CKD), this pharmacologic interaction plausibly potentiates hepatocellular necrosis and explains concurrent mucosal/CNS findings. The clinical pattern is hepatocellular (expected ALT > AST \u226b ALP) and the presence of encephalopathy with presumed INR >1.5 and elevated bilirubin meets criteria for non-acetaminophen acute liver failure. RUCAM totals 7 (Probable), with TMP-SMX as the primary culprit and methotrexate as a significant co-factor. Immediate management includes withdrawal of both agents, initiation of N-acetylcysteine, aggressive supportive care, and ICU-level monitoring."
